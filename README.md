# color-flipper
I made a simple color flipper program based off a popular existing project

The first version, called "Simple Color Flipper", used an array with four predetermined colors, which were picked using a function that picked a random number corresponding to the index, or position in the array

The second version, called "Hex", has an array with numbers and letters. This array is plugged into a for loop and random number generator function to create a six character long word which corresponds to a specific color.
